# secure_coding_projects

This repository contains my solutions to tasks of the course web application security and secure coding at TalTech.


Contents:

  1. Crypto2022/ConsoleAppCaesar -> encrypt/decrypt caesar cipher console application
  2. Crypto2022/ConsoleAppCaesar -> encrypt/decrypt caesar cipher using UTF encoding console application
  3. Crypto2022/ConsoleAppDH -> calculate or try to brute force Diffie-Hellman console application
  3. Crypto2022/ConsoleAppRSA -> calculate or try to brute force RSA console application
  4. Crypto2022/ConsoleAppVigenere -> encrypt/decrypt vigenere cipher console application
  5. Web2022 -> web application using MVC structure, which deals with cryptographic algorithms such as Caesar, RSA and calculation of DIffie Hellman
